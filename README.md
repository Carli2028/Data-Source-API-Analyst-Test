# Data-Source-API-Analyst-Test
Homework assignment for the Data Source API Analyst role. This project demonstrates API research, data extraction, error handling, and documentation using GitHub’s public API.

## Repository Structure

Data-Source-API-Analyst-Test/
├── README.md ← You are here
├── Content/
│ ├── github_api_reference.md ← Research notes about GitHub API
│ ├── api_extraction.py ← Python code for authentication, extraction, errors
│ ├── troubleshooting_guide.md ← Guide for common issues and fixes
├── Postman_Collection/
│ └── github_api_test.ipynb ← Google Colab notebook used for API tests

## Objectives

- Research and understand GitHub public API
- Extract public data such as:
  - Public repositories
  - Commit history
  - File/folder contents
- Use Python in Google Colab to extract, process, and validate the data
- Implement pagination, rate-limit handling, and error responses
- Prepare Postman or Colab output and upload to GitHub

## Tools Used

- **Python** (requests, pandas)
- **Google Colab** (for API interaction and visualization)
- **GitHub API** (RESTful access to public repositories)
- **Postman** (for optional manual testing)

## Status

- GitHub API researched
- Token and headers configured
- First API requests tested
- Troubleshooting doc started
- Colab Notebook in progress
- All files committed to GitHub

## Personal Reflection

This task allowed me to better understand how APIs work in real projects and gave me hands-on experience troubleshooting real-world errors. It also helped me gain more confidence using Google Colab and Python to extract and analyze data.
